			<h1>The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>dog</span>&#169;</h1>
			<p>
			The <span>dog</span> or domestic <span>dog</span> (Canis familiaris)[4] is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, characterized by an upturning tail. 
			The <span>dog</span> derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,[5][6] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.
			[7] The <span>dog</span> was the first species to be domesticated,[8][7] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[6] before the 
			development of agriculture.<br/>
			
			Due to their long association with humans, <span>dog</span>s have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[9] and gained 
			the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[10] Over the millennia, 
			<span>dog</span>s became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.[11]
