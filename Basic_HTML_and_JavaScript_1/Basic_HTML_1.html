		The term <b>"biosphere"</b> was coined by geologist Eduard Suess in 1875, which he defined as the place on Earth's surface where life dwells.[6] While the concept has a geological origin, it is an indication of the effect of both Charles Darwin and Matthew F. Maury on the Earth sciences. 
		<i>The biosphere's ecological context comes from the 1920s (see Vladimir I. Vernadsky), preceding the 1935 introduction of the term "ecosystem" by Sir Arthur Tansley (see ecology history)</i>.
		Vernadsky defined ecology as the science of the biosphere. It is an interdisciplinary concept for integrating astronomy, geophysics, meteorology, biogeography, evolution, geology, geochemistry, hydrology and, generally speaking, all life and Earth sciences.

		Geochemists define the biosphere as <u>being the total sum of living organisms (the <i>"biomass"</i> or "biota" as referred to by biologists and ecologists)</u>. In this sense, the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model, the other three being geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. When these four component spheres are combined into one system, it is known as the Ecosphere. This term was coined during the 1960s and encompasses both biological and physical components of the planet.[7]
